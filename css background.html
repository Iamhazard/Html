Most of the people will probably not go through the description. Ani uni haru lai chai ma k vanna chaahaanxu vani, esso kholera herdim na k raixa, kaso raixa, kasto raixa. Maanxe kasto mehenat le, kasto kastha uthaayera likhiraako hunxa yo bigreko laptop ma. Aaddhaa keybord chalni aadhaa nachalni laptop ma. Display bela bela club ko disco ball jastai jhip jhip garni laptop ma. Balla talla description fill gareko hunxa. Kta kt haru baal na di hururururu skip haandinxan yar. Balla talla garera geet ni lekhnu xa, description ni lekhnu xa. Maanxe haru "geet nasuni like haanni yeta haajir garu hai" vandai comment thokxan. 
Laptop in banaam vaneko yo lockdown le aacchu aacchu paareko xa. Repair shop le ni kasto mahango vaneko. Dashain Tihar ma jackpot ko chitthaa pareko jasto. 

Aru kura testai ho, now turning to a bit more serious description, ***aba serious vanera skip haanni kaam chai nagaram ni feri***
This song is something different than what I'm normally used to writing. I feel like I could have delivered this song with a lot more improvements, but as quarantine happened, I wasn't able to properly communicate with the studio and put the amount of effort into research into a genre like this. The date was just getting pushed back and it felt like it was not going to get completed. So we mustered up the collated inspiration and committed ourselves to completing the song.
I had a wonderful experience at the studio. Kobid daju is like this super cool multi instrumentalist with mind freaking production skills. He's 28 tara looks 22. I think he uses fair and lovely. I don't know. Studio ko euta rack ma dekheko thiye. Kasko ho vanda budi ko vannu vo. Malai ajhai sakhnaa laai raakhyaa xa. Teti bela ta 'ehhh' vanera chhoddeko.
Also, malai Amar daju le manage gardinxa. So, I'm not "indie" anymore. Amar dai na vaako vaye shaayad yo geet aauna ajhai 3 months jati laagthyo hola. So, dhannyawaad malai bike ma sararara lagera studio ma Kobid dai sanga vetaaideko ma. Although "Indie Artist" wala tag sounds cooler, but meh.... Btw, Amar daju is actually 22, tara he looks 28 feri. So, arko acchhamma ko kuro. 
Ani, this video was made by Gaurav Tamang. He told me not to mention his name because he's not proud of this work for some reason. "khichadi paakako jasto vayo" vandai thiyo. He actually said that to sound cool. Like "Taw saathi hos. Tero kaam ko ma paisa ni linna, credit ni linna." type ko image create garna. I made him work for two days straight without sleep. I actually feel bad. Tara telle ni kich kich garx. So, meh..
